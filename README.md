## Good to know
- "central.hpp" is meant to finally be a pre-compiled header
- All planned usage of externally produced materials follows permitted terms stated in the relative license copy.

## IMPLEMENTATION

- Threads arent used so far, [read why](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/README/emscripten)

- Stuff are meant to be visualized in tree models or charts

- Program first initializes the "root object"
- the "root object" is defined in "mainloop.cpp"
- the "main loop" is also defined there
- Parent object spawns their objects from "layer 1"
- All objects except Root are spawned in a vector
- Child objects are spawned in a "layer" above the parent
- Objects are part of a "tree" structure

- Paths to files are defined in "data"
- "data" contains .csv files
- path to "data" is defined in "filesystem.hpp"


## Stuff I've learnt:

- GPU calculation symmetric dimensions of pixels, e.g. 100x100 not 100x92 by default
- Vector implementation
- SDL library (basic knowledge by now)
-
