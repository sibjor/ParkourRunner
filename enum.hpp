/* 

    ***ENUM CLASS IMPLEMENTATIONS***

    ***AFTER DEFINING ENUM CLASSES, STRUCTS AND CLASSES ARE DEFINED IN THEIR RESPECTIVE FILES***

    ***WE STRIVE TO FOLLOW PRINCIPLES DEFINED BELOW***

    - Tries to avoid duplication and redundancy.
    - Functions should be nested
    - Fields should be nested
    - Structs should inherit from parent
    - Classes should inherit from parent

    ***DID YOU KNOW?***

    - Enum classes are used to define a set of named constants
    - Enum classes are strongly typed, meaning that the values of an enum class are not implicitly convertible to integers or other types
    - Enum classes are scoped, meaning that the names of the enumerators are not visible outside the enum class
    - Enum classes are used to improve code readability and maintainability

    ***THE 7 PRINCIPLES OF OOP***
    - Encapsulation
    - Abstraction
    - Inheritance
    - Polymorphism
    - Composition
    - Aggregation
    - Association

    ***SOLID PRINCIPLES***
    - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
    - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
    - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
    - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
    - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
